MAKING BRANCHES
git branch - tells what branch you're one
git branch <newbranchname> - makes a new branch
git checkout <branchname> - swiches branches to new branch name

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3876977/update-git-branches-from-master
update branch from master
git fetch
git rebase origin/master


MERGE BRANCH WITH MASTER
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601931/best-and-safest-way-to-merge-a-git-branch-into-master
update master from branch
git checkout <branchname>
git status

<<THIS IS JUST A NOTE>>
<<do this only if there are files you need to add after doing "git status">>
git add (add whatever files your want to merge with your master)
git commit -m "place commit message here")
git push
<<THIS WAS JUST A NOTE>>

git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge <branchname>
git push origin master


DELETING A BRANCH
LOCALLY (on your computer)
git checkout master
git branch -d <branch_name>

REMOTELY (on the repository) -- you should probably only do this to branches you own by the way
git push origin --delete <branchname>
